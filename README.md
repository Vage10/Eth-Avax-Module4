Contract Details
Contract Address: [Insert Contract Address Here]
Network: Avalanche
Functionality
Minting New Tokens
Only the owner of the smart contract has the authority to mint new tokens. As the owner, you can create and distribute tokens to players as rewards for their contributions to Degen Gaming.

Transferring Tokens
Players have the ability to transfer their Degen Gaming tokens to other participants within the platform. This functionality facilitates peer-to-peer token transactions and enables a seamless transfer of value between players.

Redeeming Tokens
Players can redeem their Degen Gaming tokens for various in-game items available in the Degen Gaming store. This feature incentivizes players to earn and accumulate tokens, as they can utilize them to access exclusive in-game content.

Checking Token Balance
At any time, players can easily check their Degen Gaming token balance. This transparency allows users to keep track of their token holdings and make informed decisions about their in-game activities.

Burning Tokens
In the spirit of decentralization and user autonomy, anyone can burn their own Degen Gaming tokens that they no longer need or want. Burning tokens removes them from circulation and reduces the total supply of tokens, influencing the overall token economy.

Getting Started
To interact with the Degen Gaming ERC20 token on the Avalanche network, you can utilize popular Ethereum wallets and tools that support the Avalanche network, such as Metamask with Avalanche Network configuration.

Please note that while using this smart contract, you should be cautious about the transactions you execute, as all actions are irreversible on the blockchain.

Example Transactions
